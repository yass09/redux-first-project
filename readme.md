# Learn Redux Project

Just a repo of a project made to learn how to use Redux, although small, with the help of Wes Bos' training course.

The project consists of an mock Instagram-like app.

Just clone repo and hit the usual "npm install" command to get the project installed.
Then just run "npm start" and move to your browser at "localhost:7770".

Enjoy!

## Production Build

To see the finished product just run `npm build` to create a dist folder and a bundle.js file.
